# simple-python-game
A simple python attack game, with no real user interaction. 

Basically what happens is you start with three lives, each turn that goes by there is a 2/3 chance you will lose a life and a 1/3 chance you will lose a life. Every round it checks whether you are dead (whether you have less than or equal to zero lives). Once you get to zero, you lose. There is no winning.

This is a stupid script I made in a few minutes so don't take it too seriously.
